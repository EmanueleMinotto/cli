NAME
----
puli - PHP's powerful resource manager

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'puli' [--help] [--quiet] [--verbose] [--version] [--ansi]
     [--no-ansi] [--no-interaction]
     <command> [<sub-command>] [<arg1>] ... [<argN>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Puli is a PHP library that manages files, directories and other resources in a
repository - much like a virtual file system. _Resources_ can be anything, but
usually we use the term for machine-processed files that are not PHP, such as
CSS, JavaScript, XLIFF, YAML, XML or HTML files.

ARGUMENTS
---------

<command>::
     The name of the command to execute. The list of commands is displayed in
     the output of `puli`.

<sub-command>::
     Some Puli commands have sub-commands. Pass the name of a sub-command in
     this argument. You can list the commands and their sub-commands with
     `puli -a`.

<arg*>::
     The arguments of the command. Run `puli <command> -h` to learn more about
     the arguments supported by a command.

OPTIONS
-------

--help, -h::
     Print the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands.

--quiet, -q::
     Mute all output of the command.

--verbose, -v, -vv, -vvv::
     Enable verbose output of the command. You can enable three levels of
     verbosity. The option '-v' enables slightly verbose, '-vv' more verbose and
     '-vvv' very verbose output.

--version, -V::
     Print the version of Puli.

--ansi::
     Enable colorization of the output. If the terminal supports colorization,
     the output will be colorized by default.

--no-ansi::
     Disable output colorization. This is useful if you want to process the
     output of a command in a script.

--no-interaction, -n::
     Disable all dialogs and assumes the suggested answers. This is useful for
     running a command in a script.
